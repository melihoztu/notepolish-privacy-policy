# Privacy Policy for NotePolish AI

**Last updated:** December 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Melih Ramazan Öztürk collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application NotePolish AI (the "App").

By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
Our App is designed to prioritize your privacy. We do not require you to create an account to use the App.

### 1.1 Camera and Photo Library
The App requires access to your device's camera and photo library to function.
* **Purpose:** To scan handwritten notes and save the enhanced "sketchnotes" back to your device.
* **Storage:** Your original notes and the generated images are stored locally on your device. We do not store your images on our own servers.

### 1.2 Image Processing (AI)
To provide the "Beautify" feature, the App uses artificial intelligence.
* **Service Provider:** We use **Google Gemini API** (provided by Google LLC) to analyze and transform your notes.
* **Data Transfer:** When you click "Beautify," the image of your note is temporarily transmitted to Google's servers for processing.
* **Data Privacy:** According to Google's API terms, data submitted via the API is used to generate the response and is not used to train their models.
* **No Permanent Storage:** We do not retain the images sent to the AI after the process is complete.

## 2. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
We offer paid subscriptions ("Pro Access") within the App.

* **Payment Processing:** All financial transactions are handled directly by **Apple (App Store)**. We do not process or store your credit card information or billing address.
* **Subscription Management:** We use **RevenueCat**, a third-party service, to manage subscription status and validate receipts.
    * **Data Shared:** RevenueCat receives an anonymous App User ID and the transaction receipt from Apple to verify if you have an active "Pro" subscription. This data does not contain your name or personal contact details.

## 3. Analytics and Crash Reporting
To improve the stability of the App, we may collect anonymous technical data (e.g., device type, iOS version, crash logs) via Apple's built-in usage reports, provided you have opted in to share analytics with developers in your iOS settings.

## 4. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
Since we operate from Germany, we comply with the GDPR.
* **Legal Basis:** We process your data (images for AI, purchase status) based on **Contractual Necessity** (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) to fulfill the service you requested (beautifying notes, providing Pro access).
* **Your Rights:** You have the right to request information about the data stored (if any) and request deletion. Since we do not store user accounts or personal images on our servers, simply deleting the App from your device will remove your local data.

## 5. Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party services, which have their own privacy policies:
* **Google Cloud / Gemini API:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* **RevenueCat:** [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)
* **Apple App Store:** [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)
